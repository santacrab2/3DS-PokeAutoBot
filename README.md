Huge Thank you to PKHeX developers, ledybot, NTR, Luma developers who all made projects like these possible.

Couldn't have made this program as pretty as it is and as user friendly without constant feedback from bewearhugs.

Check out the wiki on how to run it!

Expect frequent updates as I add more fun shit but its functional at this point.

Thank you Muchacho13Scripts for patching the wonder trade no trainer found bug.

Update 9/22/2022
- At this point the release is out of date. It needs to be updated to latest deps for pkhex and I still need to add/find all the offsets for x/y as it currently only runs on ORAS for gen 6. I am currently working on attempting to switch it from NTR debugger to Luma's Rosalina Debugger but they are different and this is relatively new to me so may take a minute. This switch should fix any issues the old 3ds has with running the software. 

Pull Requests are always welcome, contributions are always welcome, having a custom fork is always welcome, have fun with it since thats its purpose.
